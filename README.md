# Neural Style Transfer with OpenCV

This repo shows how to perform Neural Style Transfer using OpenCV. <br/>
This project uses the pretrained models by [Justin Johnson](https://github.com/jcjohnson/fast-neural-style)
The code closely follows the pyimagesearch blog by Adrian Rosebrock that you can find here: https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/08/27/neural-style-transfer-with-opencv/
